## Full-Export.sh
This bash script is used to download and combine multiple timdex files into one file, via concatenation and upload the result to the DIP ALEPH bucket
This script will hopefully be cron'd to happen once a month

## Update-Export.sh
This bash script follows the same process as the full update, but only occurs on the "updates" files that are deposited more frequently.  This file is not currently used, and is a template for later use.
